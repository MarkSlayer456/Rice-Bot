# Rice-Bot

Have you ever been to this website before: https://freerice.com/
it's a website that gives 10 grains of rice to the needy for every
question you get correct.

That brings us to this bot. This bot goes to the multiplication
section of the website and takes a screen shot of the problem and
answers and tries to answer the question (it's not perfect).
Thus generating rice for thousands of people!
